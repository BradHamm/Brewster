Brewster - Personal brewery rating and tracking application. 

## Brewster App Project

User story: As a beer enthusiast, I want to find the best local beers at quality locations and store my preferences to create a personal profile that I can share with friends.

To start the project, we organized tasks, created a wireframe, flowchart, and organized the Kanban. Concurrently, we also organized the html, css, and js; creating the appropriate number of folders etc. in VS Code. During this process, Michael and Julius helped guide us towards goals related to the above points. 

Initial stages included triaging, per the advice of Julius, having one person “drive” and the others help via Zoom, to initially build the code structure for the html, css, and js. During this process we started with the header, nav bar, and related html, css, and js. Google Fonts, the third party API, was also implemented for the title during this stage.
